This is an exercise to practice using an event handler to manipulate style properties and HTML elements together.

Clicking anywhere on the page changes the background to a random color and tells you the corresponding hexadecimal code. 

For the random color generating code, I borrowed the "one-liner" from https://randomcolor.llllll.li/.
